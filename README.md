# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI Opponent

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

The game is built as a Windows form application using C#. It supports two players, where each player can take turns playing the game, and also playing against an unbeatable AI opponent, which uses the min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 

The objective of the game is to place three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal on the game board.


## Features

- Two-player mode: The game can be played by two players taking turns to place their symbols on the game board. Each player takes turns to place their symbol, and the game continues until one player wins or the game is drawn.

- One-player mode: The game can also be played against an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI opponent uses the min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move to make. This makes it very challenging to beat the AI opponent, as it is programmed to make the best move possible every time.

- Mutliple Difficulty Levels: The AI opponent has multiple difficulty levels, ranging from easy to hard. The difficulty level can be set by the user before the game starts.
